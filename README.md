## Overview
I used Inheritance with the Account class to make sub-classes: savings_account and cd_account

The sub-classes contain functions to calculate their interest over a maturity in months

## TODO
I left some commented out code in savings_account that I wanted to get working using list comprehension to do the calculation. It didn't quite work out, but I tried for some time to get this right!
